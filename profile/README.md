  ### *Repair. Repurpose. Reinvent.*

  <p>
    <b>WNH (Why Not Hardware)</b> is a dedicated initiative for the art of repurposing obsolete hardware. <br>
    <b>Unlocking the potential of e-waste, one "voided warranty" at a time.</b>

## 🏴 The Mission

**We refuse to let silicon die.**

Founded in the **heart of Morocco** by a student at **1337 (42 Network)**, WNH exists to explore the limits of consumer hardware.

We see potential where others see junk. Our goal is to take devices that are considered "obsolete" or "limited" and make them do things they were never meant to do.

### ⚡ The Scavenger Mindset
Most local initiatives focus on new tech, robotics competitions, or academic projects. **WNH is different because we focus on E-Waste.**

While others are **buying new boards and focusing on competitions**, we are hacking routers from the junk drawer. We don't just consume technology; we salvage and reinvent it.

## 🛠️ Flagship Project

### [The 3020 Project](https://0rayn.github.io/WhyNot/posts/the-3020-project/)
> *Turning a Travel Router into a Distributed Desktop.*

A modular embedded system built around a **TL-MR3020**. It transforms a simple router into a central hub that controls a system of microcontrollers to overcome its own hardware limitations.

* **The Core:** OpenWrt Custom Build (Atheros AR9331).
* **The Graphics:** ESP32 driving a VGA screen via TCP/IP.
* **The I/O Expansion:** Arduino Nano I/O Controller (Serial).
* **Input from Within:** Keyboard support for the router and program.
* **The Result:** A live Linux terminal with physical GPIO and keyboard support.

---

## ⚡ The Stack

* **Languages:** C, Assembly, Bash, Python, Lua, Rust... (If it compiles, we use it).
* **Hardware:** MIPS, ARM, AVR, RISC-V, x86, or that random chip you found in a broken toaster.
* **Rule #1:** **RTFM** (Read The F***ing Manual), then ignore the "Safety Warnings."

## 🤝 Join The Initiative

**WNH is an open collective.**

Born in Morocco but open to the world, we welcome anyone who wants to give dead hardware a second chance.

**You don't need to bring a new project to join.**
We need help pushing our *existing* systems to the limit. Whether you want to optimize code, fix bugs, design a PCB, or just document the madness—there is a place for you here.

* **Software Wizards:** Optimize drivers, build lightweight UIs, and squeeze performance out of slow CPUs.
* **Hardware Hackers:** Trace PCBs, solder components, and design 3D-printed cases.

**Ready to contribute?** Fork a repo, submit a PR, or reach out. Let's build something weird together.
